# Constraints

## 1. External Constraints

***Program Requirements***: The CDS program's expectations for group collaboration and deliverables, such as using GitHub for documentation.

***Time Zones***: Group members are located in different parts of the world, making it challenging to find universally convenient meeting times.

***Communication Tools***: Limitations of WhatsApp and Slack for certain tasks like file sharing or code reviews.

***Solution for external constraints***

We will make a sustainable and inclusive schedule for meeting times to accommodate different time zones fairly.
We will leverage GitHub for version control and document centralization while keeping Slack and WhatsApp for quick updates.
We will set a protocol, meeting notes or summary and recordings for effective communication for those unable to attend synchronous meetings.

## 2. Internal Constraints: Involuntary

***Skill Gaps*** Not all group members may have the same proficiency in tools like GitHub or collaboration platforms.

***Time Commitment***: Some members might have more demanding schedules or competing priorities.

***Cultural Differences***: Diverse perspectives may lead to misunderstandings or disagreements.

***Solution for internal involuntary constraints***

We will assign a mentor role or a leader for technical skills like GitHub usage, ensuring all members are supported.
We will set clear expectations for minimum participation, such as checking Slack/WhatsApp daily.
We will enhance open dialogue about cultural norms to build understanding and prevent conflicts.

## 3. Internal Constraints: Voluntary

***Respecting Time***: A norm to wait 5 minutes for late members during meetings before starting.

***Conflict Resolution***: A voluntary decision to resolve conflicts one-on-one first and escalate only if needed.

***Engagement***: Choosing to actively check and contribute to all communication channels daily.

***Solution for intenal voluntary constraints***

We will create a checklist or reminders for voluntary norms to ensure consistency.
We will develop a lightweight report for unresolved conflicts to maintain harmony.
We will encourage casual interactions while having chit chat at the start of the meeting (e.g., sharing jokes) to balance work and fun.
