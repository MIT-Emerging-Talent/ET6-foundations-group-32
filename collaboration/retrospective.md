# üöÄ Retrospective

> This is the summary of our team's retrospective after our last meeting,
reflecting on the successes and challenges, what worked and what didn‚Äôt, as our
project nears its completion.

## üö´ Stop Doing

- Unclear communication, which leads to minor miscommunications.

- Scheduling meetings close to the actual meeting time, which sometimes leaves
people unavailable due to personal circumstances.

---

## üü¢ Continue Doing

- Maintaining excellent collaboration with respect, patience, and support from
everyone: using our strengths to assist others and allowing others to help with
our weaknesses.

- Arranging tutorial sessions on GitHub and code reviews to ensure all team
members clearly understand the strategy and their roles.

- Being considerate of each other's time and availability, accounting for
differences in time zones and individual circumstances.

- Organizing the project systematically, with an emphasis on fairly dividing
tasks among all members for review and completion of challenges.

---

## üöÄ Start Doing

- Arranging meetings through issues and project boards on GitHub.

- Having more discussions about debugging on GitHub instead of WhatsApp to
practice using the platform more effectively.

- Using Google Calendar to arrange meetings, which will allow us to see meeting
times and receive notifications in advance.

- Using platforms like Telegram for better accessibility to overcome internet
traffic blockage for team members residing in Myanmar.

## üìö Lessons Learned

- We learned how to support each other by considering our individual strengths
and weaknesses.

- Staying mindful of the timeline is crucial, as additional deliverables from
other workshops can make the project overwhelming for team members near the end.

- Being open to suggestions helped us gain valuable insights by allowing us to
learn from the feedback and perspectives of others.

- We achieved our preset collective learning goals:
  - Learned and practiced documentation.
  - Learned and practiced code review and project collaboration on GitHub.

## üìã Strategy vs. Board

### ‚úÖ What parts of your plan went as expected?

- Clear delegation of tasks helped everyone know their responsibilities.

- The tutorial sessions we held on using GitHub management tools before starting
the tasks ensured that all team members understood and used them efficiently.

- We successfully created issues and pull requests, linking them to the
appropriate steps or columns in the project board.

- Overall, our strategy aligned well with the project board most of the time.

### ‚ùå What parts of your plan did not work out?

- At times, members forgot to move the issues on the project board after
completing each step.

- Minor miscommunications occurred on a few occasions when it was not clear who
would review each challenge or merge the pull requests.

- We agreed on the idea of holding weekly meetings, but they never took place.

- Ruff CI errors occurred due to a breaking change in a new version. We had to
inform all members to update their extensions and fix files that failed the CI checks.
