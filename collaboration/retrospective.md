# 🚀 Retrospective

> This is the summary of our team's retrospective after our last meeting,
reflecting on the successes and challenges, what worked and what didn’t, as our
project nears its completion.

## 🚫 Stop Doing

- Unclear communication, which leads to minor miscommunications.

- Scheduling meetings close to the actual meeting time, which sometimes leaves
people unavailable due to personal circumstances.

---

## 🟢 Continue Doing

- Maintaining excellent collaboration with respect, patience, and support from
everyone: using our strengths to assist others and allowing others to help with
our weaknesses.

- Arranging tutorial sessions on GitHub and code reviews to ensure all team
members clearly understand the strategy and their roles.

- Being considerate of each other's time and availability, accounting for
differences in time zones and individual circumstances.

- Organizing the project systematically, with an emphasis on fairly dividing
tasks among all members for review and completion of challenges.

---

## 🚀 Start Doing

- Arranging meetings through issues and project boards on GitHub.

- Having more discussions about debugging on GitHub instead of WhatsApp to
practice using the platform more effectively.

- Using Google Calendar to arrange meetings, which will allow us to see meeting
times and receive notifications in advance.

- Using platforms like Telegram for better accessibility to overcome internet
traffic blockage for team members residing in Myanmar.

## 📚 Lessons Learned

- We learned how to support each other by considering our individual strengths
and weaknesses.

- Staying mindful of the timeline is crucial, as additional deliverables from
other workshops can make the project overwhelming for team members near the end.

- Being open to suggestions helped us gain valuable insights by allowing us to
learn from the feedback and perspectives of others.

- We achieved our preset collective learning goals:
  - Learned and practiced documentation.
  - Learned and practiced code review and project collaboration on GitHub.
